Usage:
Prepare your SMILES files: Create text files where each file contains a list of SMILES strings, one per line.

This command will calculate all available molecular descriptors for the SMILES strings in each file,\
 plot the distributions of these descriptors, and save the plots in the specified output directory.\
 Adjust the parameters and paths as necessary for your specific dataset and requirements.

Run the script: Use the following command to execute the script.
python compare_descriptors.py smiles_file1.txt smiles_file2.txt --labels "Set1,Set2" --output_dir plots
